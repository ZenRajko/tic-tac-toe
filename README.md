# TIC-TAC-TOE: A Classic Game of Man vs Machine

A simple, single-player game built with React and Typescript, and using a few CSS tricks and animations to create some classy visuals.

:zap: Now with a choice of two opponent types! The easy Random Clicker, and the more challenging Astute Antagonist.

### AI Contributions

This game was created for fun, but also as an experiment in AI-assisted game development.
Copilot was used to generate the green felt background and the tile images, as well as the initial structure of the app.
Since then, I added/changed much of the code and CSS to get the theme I was going for. The tile images were adjusted/cropped in Paint.NET.

It was handy getting getting the initial app up and running with Copilot, and generating the game art with it was definitely the biggest win. 
Not only was it a massive time saver, but allows you to create the theme you want even if your artistic abilities are not up to it. 
AI-assisted development is definitely helpful, and with a small project like this Copilot didn't produce any buggy code.

But at some point in the development process, I found it easier to visualise and write the code myself rather than explain what I wanted to the AI, and more satisfying.
I think this is probably a result of decades of practice at writing code, and the pleasure that came from it. 
Which suggests AI-assisted development will be more attractive to beginners or those entering the industry, and certainly lowers the bar for entry which is good overall.
